CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. It is stated in the syllabus that "The outside code resources students will
   be allowed to use in assignments for this class are limited to code written
   by the course staff for the purposes of helping students in the course, or
   code from the textbook for this course." So I think we're not allowed to
   directly use any online sources.


2. one head and one tail: 50%; two heads: 25%; two tails: 25%
   The one head and one tail outcome has the highest possibility because the the 
   two tosses are independent of each other, and each have the same possibilities 
   of having a head or a tail. So the four results are of the same possibilities:
   "head, head", "head, tail", "tail, head", "tail, tail". Among these four, two
   of the belongs to the "one head and one tail" outcome, giving it a 50% overall
   possibility.


3. I did each 5 trials with input "500", "1000" and "5000". Two out of five failed 
   for 500, one out of five failed for 1000, and all passed for 5000. It may be roughly
   concluded that the required number of trials would be of the magnitude 10^3 to 10^4.
   
   Approaching this problem theoretically, the question can be translated into: "How
   many trials are required to be 95% (or any appropriate value) confident that the
   result for any of the three cases fall within 1% error of their expectations."
   Simplifying it a little, we only consider the case of one head and one tail with 50%
   possibility. Each trial qualifies as a Bernouli trial with p = 0.5. The actual number
   of getting this outcome after N trials follows binomial distribution, which can be
   approximated by normal distribution when N is fairly large. The standard deviation would
   be sigma = 0.5 N^0.5. We are 95% confident that the outcome would fall within 1.96 sigma
   from the expectation, 0.5N. Here, we want 1.96 sigma to be smaller than 0.01 N. After
   calculation, N should be larger than 9604, about 10^4. 
   It can thus be concluded theoretically that about 10^4 trials are required to be 95% confident 
   that the outcome of the one head and one tail case fall within 1% error of its expectation.
   Similar analysis can be done for other confidence levels or outcomes.

   The answer can also be determined practically by writing a program which runs the simulation
   a sufficient amount of times and recording the results. Details are omitted here.
